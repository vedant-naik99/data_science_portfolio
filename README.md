# Data Science Portfolio
Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of iPython Notebooks, and R markdown files (published at RPubs).
## Projects
* [Data visualization of NOAA Storm database](https://rpubs.com/ved1999/644535): The analysis of following questions were done-
  + Across the United States, which types of events (as indicated in the EVTYPE variable) are most harmful with respect to population health?
  + Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?
* [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Analysis](https://github.com/vedant-naik99/gcd-project)
  + Data was collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.
  + run_analysis.R that does the following:
   1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
   2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
   3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
   4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
   5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
* [MTcars database Regression analysis](https://rpubs.com/ved1999/685927): The analysis of following questions were done-
  + Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG?
  + Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions
* [ML using gbm and random forrest for predictions](https://github.com/vedant-naik99/Practical-Machine-Learning-Course-Project)
  + Used random forrest and gbm to make predict the manner in which they did the exercise. 
* [COVID-Tracker](https://github.com/vedant-naik99/Covid-Tracker)
  + This website was used by using shiny package in R. This site is updated once daily.
  + The aim of this site is to complement the above resources by providing several interactive features like the timeline function and the regional plots.
